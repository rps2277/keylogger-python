1. Introduction
Project Overview
This document provides information about a basic keylogger project implemented in Python. The keylogger records key presses and stores them in a log file.

Purpose and Use Cases
The primary purpose of this keylogger is for educational and security research. It can be used to understand how keyloggers work, improve computer security, or analyze user behavior within the scope of ethical and legal guidelines.

Disclaimer
Important: Using keyloggers for unauthorized and malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization before deploying or using this software.

2. Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pynput library
Installation Steps
Install Python: If Python is not already installed on your system, download and install it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install pynput: Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command to install the pynput library using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pynput

3. Usage
Running the Keylogger
Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the keylogger script is located.

Run the keylogger script using Python:

bash
Copy code
python keylogger.py
The keylogger will start capturing key presses.

Viewing the Log
The keylogger logs keystrokes to a file called "keylog.txt" in the same directory where the script is located. You can open this file to view the recorded keystrokes.

Stopping the Keylogger
To stop the keylogger, press Ctrl+C in the terminal or command prompt where it is running. This will terminate the script.

4. Project Structure
File Descriptions
keylogger.py: The main keylogger script.
keylog.txt: The log file where keystrokes are recorded.
Code Organization
The code is organized into functions, making it easy to understand and modify. The keylogger functionality is primarily contained in the on_key_release function.

5. Configuration
Customizing Keylogger Behavior
You can customize the keylogger's behavior by modifying the on_key_release function. For example, you can change how keys are recorded, where the log file is saved, or how special keys are handled.

6. Security and Privacy
Legal and Ethical Considerations
Using keyloggers without consent is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have the explicit permission of the user before deploying or using this software. Respect privacy and adhere to local laws and regulations.

Responsible Use
This keylogger is intended for educational purposes and responsible security research. Use it responsibly and only in controlled environments.

7. Troubleshooting
Common Issues
If you encounter any issues while running the keylogger, check the following:

Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.
Verify that you are running the script with appropriate permissions.
Check for any exceptions or errors in the terminal or command prompt.
Support and Contact Information

8. Conclusion
Summary
This document provided an overview of a basic keylogger project in Python, its installation and usage instructions, and information about responsible use, legal considerations, and customization options.

Future Improvements
The project can be extended with additional features, such as remote logging, encryption, or more advanced configuration options. Consider further development based on your needs and ethical guidelines.

Remember: Always use keyloggers responsibly, respecting privacy and the law.
